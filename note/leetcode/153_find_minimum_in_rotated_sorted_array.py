153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Medium

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums: return -1

        left, right = 0, len(nums)-1

        # left == right 时，就是最小的值
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2

            if nums[mid] > nums[right]:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid
        
        return nums[left]
